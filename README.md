# UmodelAutoAes

# How to use
- Download the exe from the below badge
- Move the exe to your umodel folder
- If you have a bat file (and if you don't you can use the example.bat, just replace the path), remove your -aes argument and replace "umodel.exe" with "UmodelAutoAes.exe"
- When running your bat file, it will auto grab the aes key from a page i maintain, which will then be fed into umodel (in the same folder) alongside your other arguments in your bat file.

# Maintenance
This is all reliant on me keeping [this](https://github.com/Lucas7yoshi/Lucas7yoshi.github.io/blob/master/aes.html) up to date so if i forget to update it, PLEASE let me know <3
